### Daily Reminder

A daily reminder can be sent every day at a specific hour. Here is an example JSON payload for creating a daily reminder:
```json
{
  "chat_id": "-10015666595133",
  "message": "Hello this is a test.",
  "type_schedule_id": 1,
  "schedules": {
    "schedules": [
      {"day": 1, "hour_of_execution": "11:30"},
      {"day": 2, "hour_of_execution": "11:30"},
      {"day": 3, "hour_of_execution": "11:30"},
      {"day": 4, "hour_of_execution": "11:30"},
      {"day": 5, "hour_of_execution": "11:30"},
      {"day": 6, "hour_of_execution": "11:30"},
      {"day": 7, "hour_of_execution": "11:30"}
    ]
  },
  "setting_id": 1
}
```

### Specific Reminder
A specific reminder is sent at a specific day and hour of the month. Here is an example JSON payload for creating a specific reminder:
```json
{
  "chat_id": "-1001962703227",
  "type_schedule_id": 2,
  "schedules": {
    "schedule": {
      "day_of_month": 27,
      "execution_hour": "10:00"
    }
  },
  "setting_id": 2,
  "message": "Hi Specific Test"
}
```

| Params        | Value.        |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| reminder_id  |  ID of the reminder to be sent |

```
POST {{HOST}}/telegram_triggers
```

<hr/>


TelegramJobs -> You can use this endpoint to force the execution of the job that is responsible for sending automatic reminder messages without user interaction.

```
POST {{HOST}}/telegram_jobs
```

<hr/>

## ReminderJob

ReminderJob is a background job that sends reminders to Telegram chats based on their schedule.

### How it works

ReminderJob is a Ruby class that inherits from ActiveJob::Base. It performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves all active reminders from the database.
2. For each reminder, checks if it's time to send the message based on its schedule.
3. If it's time, sends the message to the corresponding chat using the TelegramNotifier service.

### How to use it

Invoke ReminderJob manually using the following command:
```rails
ReminderJob.perform_now
```

Alternatively, you can make a GET request to the TelegramJobs controller. This allows you to use an online tool like https://www.easycron.com/ to schedule the job instead of relying on your computer's crontab. Simply schedule the request to the controller to run every 20 minutes, and all your reminders will be sent automatically without any further interaction required.
